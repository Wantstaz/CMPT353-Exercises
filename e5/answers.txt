Exercise 5 Answer

Question 1.
The result of np.exp is nan. Among the remaining three methods, np.sqrt has the p-value nearest to 0.05.

Question 2.
For the original t-test, if we reject the null hypothesis, there are unequal numbers of comments on r/canada on weekdays and weekends according to the original data.
For the transformed data t-test, the number of transformed (sqrt) reviews differs between weekdays and weekends according to the transformed data.

Question 3.
CLT is the best because under the condition of relatively large sample size, the p-value obtained by t-test of the reprocessed data is > 0.05, so the null hypothesis can be rejected, which proves that the number of comments on weekday and weekend is different. It also proves that these data can present a normal distribution, so it is relatively good among the three methods.

Question 4.
By comparing weekdays and weekends with mean(), it can be seen that the data of weekdays and weekends are 1823.5785440613026 and 1269.5071770334928 respectively. So weekdays have more comments.

Exercise 10 Answers

Question 1.
How long did your reddit_averages.py take with (1) the reddit-0 data set and effectively no work, (2) no schema specified and not caching (on reddit-2 for this and the rest), (3) with a schema but not caching, (4) with both a schema and caching the twice-used DataFrame? [The reddit-0 test is effectively measuring the Spark startup time, so we can see how long it takes to do the actual work on reddit-2 in the best/worst cases.]

reddit-0(for test, not really doing any work): 
real	0m6.374s
user	0m16.129s
sys	0m1.747s

reddit-2(no schema, no cache):
real	0m25.904s
user	0m30.948s
sys	0m2.059s

reddit-2(with schema, no cache):
real	0m18.734s
user	0m25.885s
sys	0m1.737s

reddit-2(with schema, with cache):
real	0m16.026s
user	0m35.164s
sys	0m1.878s

Question 2.
Based on the above, does it look like most of the time taken to process the reddit-2 data set is in reading the files, or calculating the averages?

Most of the time taken to process the reddit-2 data set is in reading the files. And reading files and caching can be processed faster by using schemas, which can improve the speed of calculating averages.
We can see that the running time of the second set of data (reddit-2 without schema & cache) is 25.904s, and the running time of the third set of data (reddit-2 with schema but without cache) is 18.734s. It can be inferred that the running time is shortened by 25.904s-18.734s=7.17s by using the schema.
Comparing the third set of data (reddit-2 with schema but without cache) and the fourth set of data (reddit-2 with schema & cache) in the same way, it is concluded that the running time is shortened by 18.734s-16.026=2.708s by using cache.
According to the results of comparing data we can say the program is spending more time reading the file.

Question 3.
Where did you use .cache() in your wikipedia_popular.py? [Hint: the answer had better be “once”… but where?]

If the answer had better be "once", I used the cache() once before the groupby() function. 
After using the filter to process the data, we get data that can be used multiple times. These data will be used for the groupby() and join() operations, so using the cache() before the groupby() will improve the running time and after cleaning the data by filter to avoid unnecessary operation.

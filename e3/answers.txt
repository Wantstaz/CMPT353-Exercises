Exercise 3.

Question 1.
By observing the two generated curves, the curve generated by Kalman smoothing is not as smooth as the curve generated by LOESS smoothing, because Kalman smoothing is more inclined to reflect the fluctuation of data. By adjusting the parameters, LOESS smoothing can obtain a smoother curve than Kalman smoothing, because LOESS smoothing will reduce the weight of some outliers and peaks, which makes it difficult for the curve generated by LOESS to display more details. In contrast to LOESS smoothing, Kalman smoothing can adjust the sensitivity to outliers and peaks.

Question 2. 
The distance between the previous location and the current location can be estimated from accelerometer and gyroscope data. This calculation provides the necessary parameters to formulate expressions for latitude and longitude, predicts motion patterns, and simplifies the implementation of Kalman smoothing in route prediction. More accurate predictions are made by combining GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope data and using dead reckoning methods based on motion measurements. Additionally, by utilizing known routes, subsequent latitude and longitude coordinates can be estimated, taking into account any position changes that may have occurred.

Question 1.In the hint above, what is the result of the calculation data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept? What is the type, and describe the values.

The result of data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept in the hint above produces the y-values for the best-fit line. The meaning of the representative is the predicted rating value of a fitted linear regression of tweet date and rating.
The result value is of float type.The result is a fitted line on the graph, where data['timestamp'] is used as the x-values for tweet dates and data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept is used as the corresponding y-values for corresponding predicted ratings.

Question 2. In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph? Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot?

Because the timestamp value is derived from the "created_at" value, by converting the "created_at" values to timestamps, we can use them as x-values in the scatterplot and calculate the corresponding y-values using the best-fit line equation. timestamp and created_at store the same data but are represented in different forms, timestamp store data as a number, and created_at store data as a datetime. But linregress function only works with numbers. So with this pairing, we are able to plot the actual data points and overlay the best-fit line on the scatterplot.
